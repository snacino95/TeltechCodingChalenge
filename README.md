## Description: 
    ### Use an application to add numbers to block list, or to add additional information for certain callers.
    ### Application uses CallDirectoryExtension for adding or removing phone numbers to iOS call directory.
    ### Make sure to enable call blocking & Identification under setting -> phone 
    
## TODO: 
    ### Currently it is not possible to add label when adding identification, need to review UI design.
    ### Improve fetching data, currently every number which is saved is loaded in memory, could cause problems when dealing 
    with larger datasets.
    ### Add detailed number verification.
    ### Improve testing cases.
